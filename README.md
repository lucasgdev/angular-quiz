This is a test with a form made for CI&T.

Main used Technologies, Methodologies, Tools and Utilities:

AngularJs
Angular Material
SASS
Gulp
NPM
Ui-Router
BEM
To run the application, go to Terminal and reach the cloned repository, then run commands:

npm install
gulp
No errors Tks Shen Long, After 'gulp' command a server should start with application up and running! :)

PS.: It should work on any screen size, if there's a problem in yours please let me know. I suggest use Chrome for a better experience.
